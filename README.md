# Simulated_Annealing_LMFit_Exponential_distributions
Using the MLfit library, I perform Simulated Annealing on exponentially distributed data using Maximum Likelihood as the Objective Function

[LMfit_exponentials.ipynb](./LMfit_exponentials.ipynb) is a very good starting point to understand the fitting technique since it has exponential-distribution generating functions to create fitting data on-the-fly
